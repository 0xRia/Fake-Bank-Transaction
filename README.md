OBJECTIVE:
To simulate a banking system that tracks and records fake transactions.
Use various regulations and with the help of AI/ML logic to help detect suspicious transactions.
Understand how fraud patterns appear in transaction histories.
Build a solid foundation for future projects like for fraud dashboards or phishing bots.


FEATURES:
Bank transaction simulator: fake deposits, withdrawals, transfers
Fraud regulations engine : e.g., flagging sudden large and repetitive transfers, or transfers to blacklisted accounts.
AI/ML Fraud prediction( to be added in the future) : Using basic ML to classify fraud/non-fraud
Email/Alert system -  when fraud is detected, alerts user/admin
Dashboard -  simple interface to view flagged transactions


GOAL:
To learn white-hat hacking
To showcase a mix of my Economics & Cybersecurity skills
And to be internship ready


TOOLS:
Programming: Python
Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, smtplib, tkinter(GUI), matplotlib/seaborn
Data storage: CSV or SQLite
Fraud detection’; regulations-based + (ML: logistics regression or decision tree)
Platforms: local machine + github repository
